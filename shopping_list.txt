"Dance in the Dark" is a song written, produced and arranged by American singer Lady Gaga
 (pictured) and Fernando Garibay. It is taken from her third extended play, The Fame Monster (2009)â€”
the reissue of her debut studio album, The Fame (2008). It is about a girl who prefers to have sex in
 the dark as she is insecure about her body. A Europop track containing retro and new-wave influences, 
it begins with a stuttering introduction and includes a spoken memorial as an interlude. Critics praised 
the song for its chorus and theme, although some found its production formulaic. Retrospective reviewers ranked
 the song as one of Gaga's best. "Dance in the Dark" reached the top ten on charts in Poland, Hungary and the Czech
 Republic, as well as the US Dance/Electronic Digital Song chart. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.
 Gaga performed "Dance in the Dark" as the opening song of The Monster Ball Tour, at the 2010 Brit Awards and at her Las Vegas residency,
